# RainCoin - Source Code

This is a game created in python using the pygame lubrary alongside with my 2d game engine/framework [TLengPy2]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://github.com/TheooKing/TLengPy2))

The game is compiled into an .exe file, though I am unsure if it still works on windows.

## Game Objective

For the objective of the game is simple, you just need to get as many coins as possible, while time progresses the coins start to get faster and faster.

### Known bug:

There is a known bug for the coins, their rectangle-hitbox gets displaced from the image in a weird way. I am unsure if I am going to fix this, but I will accept anyones solve.
